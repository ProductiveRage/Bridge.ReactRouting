			// following) together keeps each route's code localised while still allowing a static navigation interface to be created. When the user needs
			// to be sent to the an "Accommodation" sub-page, there won't be code to send them to "/Accommodation/xyz", a call will instead to be made to
			// the "Accommodation" method of this class, providing the sub-page id, and the target URL will be returned. This ensures that there is no
			// chance of changes to routes here not being reflected in other code (if "Accommodation" was changed to "WhereToStay", for example, then
			// no other code need be changed since it will all be calling the "Accommodation" method; if the other code was manually trying to go to
			// "/Accommodation/xyz" then that code would also have to be changed to "/WhereToStay/xyz" in all places and any mistakes wouldn't be
